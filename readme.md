# Slim Framework skeleton application

```
composer create-project -n -s dev ivandokov/slim 
```
Add project name at the end of the command.  

Additionally you can add bash alias for easier usage next time:  
```
alias slim='composer create-project -n -s dev ivandokov/slim'
```
and use it like this:
```
slim myproject
```
